### Workshop 1: BUILD YOUR OWN CUSTOM MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
* Link: https://360idev.com/sessions/build-custom-musical-instrument/
* Presenter: `Aurelius Prochazka`
* Folder: `01_Audio`
* Xcode8

In this workshop we utilized AudioKit to build some custom soundboards.  We
learned about some of the features of the audio support for iOS.

### Workshop 2: DEVELOPING FOR APPLE WATCH WITH SWIFT
* Link: https://360idev.com/sessions/developing-apple-watch-swift/
* Presenter: `Jeff Kelley`
* Folder: `02_WatchOS`
* Xcode9

We built a watch app from scratch (a pomodoro timer):
* IB for Watch apps (the only way to build them, no code only VCs)
* Wired up the app itself with a "settings" menu (to configure the length of time)
* Wired up notifications (using UNNotificationCenter)
* Created a complication (Extra large only due to time constraints)
* moved the supported watch version back to add support for older WatchOS versions
